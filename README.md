# 01-Homework: HTML/CSS Code Refactor

1. Changed the <title> element in the head from "website" to "Horiseon SSS, Inc."

2. The first <div> element could be a header instead, so I changed it and removed the .header class, applying all CSS attributes to the <header> element instead.

3. There wasn't an ID for search engine optimization, so I added one and now all the links in the <header> work correctly.

4. Changed the <div> element under the header to <nav> to identify the navigation bar, and the corresponding CSS attributes.

5. Changed the <div> element to <section> for the .hero class for better readability.

6. Made the <div> for class .content into a <main> as it takes up the most space and seems to be the most important info on the page.

7. Added [alt=""] text for all images for screen readers.

8. Swapped the <div> elements for classes/ids: [search-engine-optimization, online-reputation management, social-media-marketing] for <section> elements.

9. Changed the <div> for the .benefits class to <aside> for better accessibility and because of the way the page is set up.

10. Swapped the <div> elements for classes: [benefit-cost, benefit-lead, benefit-brand] for <section> elements.

11. Replaced <div class="footer"> with just <footer> and applied the CSS styles for <div class="footer"> to the element <footer> instead.

12. Changed <h2> in the footer to <h4> for more logical headers throughout the page.
